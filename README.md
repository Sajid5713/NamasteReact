● Async Execution: When a page load it will parse the HTML along with fetching the script from resource and when the script code is fully fetch will pause the HTML parsing and run the script. When the script is execute then run the HTML to Finish.

● Defer Execution: It run both the HTML and fetch/download scripts from resource and after the HTML parsing is done; then run the script at the end.
